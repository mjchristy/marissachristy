In the spring of 2017, the e-commerce team at Paperless Post underwent a technical rewrite and UX facelift for our mobile web browsing experience. I led the design efforts and worked closely with engineering to scope and deliver the project in an iterative manner.

## The challenge

Millions of people each week receive cards and invitations via Paperless Post, the majority of whom on their phones. A small percentage of these people will go on to send their own cards, thus creating a viral loop, the holy grail of growth strategies.The challenge is getting receivers to send. How do you get people to send a card if they don't have a need at the moment.

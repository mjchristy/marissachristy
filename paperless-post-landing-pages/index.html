				<p>I worked to create a templatized system of product landing pages to help users understand our product and guide them to the right category.</p>

				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p>Users browsing for cards at higher level landing pages (such as all wedding or all holidays) we’re getting a mixed experience of content that wasn’t very browsable and had poorer conversion.</p>

				<p>First, let's take a look at who our users were, and how they were getting there.</p>

		<h4>Landers</h4>
		<p class="small-p">Many people come to these pages from organic search results or from SEM. This means this is the first interaction with our brand and product. If they were searching they likely have a specific need and are looking to narrow into a</p>

	</div>
	<div class="col-4">
		<h4>Browsers</h4>
		<p class="small-p">These pages are linked to from our homepage, nav and promotional spots in emails and other pages. Users that choose this method of browsing over more specific categories may want to narrow, but prefer shopping using large blocks and buttons to the navigation. <i>They are looking for guidances</i></p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-4">
		<h4>Researchers</h4>
		<p class="small-p">These users had the opportunity to narrow but chose to click the section page. This is the most interesting use case. Why do they click the section? Perhaps they need more education/context about our wedding products.</p>

<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Landing pages that successfully combines targeted merchandising and light educationwill increase new user conversion. It will do this by helping Landers narrow, guiding the Browsers, and educating the Researchers. Furthermore, we have the opportunity to speak directly to a persona, rather than a broad audience.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Develop a series of easily generated landing pages with a mix of merchandising (recommended categories and cards), product education, and editorial content.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>By using live card data, admins only had to enter card IDs and a background color. We thought these could be automated in the future.</p>

Educational “slats” offered product insight while highlighting top-performing categories of invitations and save the dates. 

Conclusion
The wedding version of the page was a winner over control, surprisingly increasing ACV by 1-2%. We have since created versions of these pages for other top level landing pages including a successful holiday page.

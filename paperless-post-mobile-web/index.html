				<p>A small team led a year-long project to redesign our entire mobile website from the ground up, including a better browse flow and a new mobile design tool. For the first time, Android users were able to send cards from their phone.</p>

				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p>Before this project, mobile web had never been top priority for Paperless Post. Even though aspects of our site were responsive, we were far from feature or ux parity. The most important difference between desktop and web was that you could only customize or send cards from our native iOS app (and the web&ndash;app hand-off wasn't great).</p>

				<h2>Phase 1: A great first impression</h2>
				<p>Before understaking the prodigious effort of a mobile create tool, we refreshed the top of our funnel. The goal of this first phase was to create a great first brand impression by providing effective product onboarding and allowing users to quickly find and favorite card designs. For iOS users, we also improved our deep linking so users who wanted to edit a card design would be taken directly to the customization tool within the app.</p>

				<h3>Phase one success metrics</h3>
				<p>Normally the number of customizes and sends are our primary success metric. As success indicators, we looked at directional metrics like number of cards viewed, favoriting, and sharing.</p>
